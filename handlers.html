          through skill levels, solving common problems, and preparing for
          competition. This isn't simplified content for mass consumption—it's
          genuine expertise made accessible through structured teaching.²

          — World's first sheepdog training app with comprehensive video library
        </p>

        <p>
          Sheepdog School earned industry awards for its innovative approach and
          created the world's first sheepdog training app. The platform
          represents more than convenience—it's democratization of knowledge.
          Young people without farm backgrounds or local mentors can now access
          systematic instruction from proven champions, studying techniques at
          their own pace, reviewing complex maneuvers repeatedly, and building
          understanding before attempting practical application.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hill's methods emphasize partnership over dominance. Using
          pressure-and-release techniques rooted in understanding canine
          behavior, she teaches handlers to communicate in the dog's own
          language. Dogs trained through this approach control their own energy,
          use initiative rather than always waiting for commands, and work
          confidently even when handlers cannot see the sheep's behavior. This
          produces not just obedient animals, but thinking partners capable of
          independent problem-solving.

        <h3>Championship Excellence</h3>
        <p>
          Julie Hill's journey into sheepdog handling demonstrates how passion
          transforms into expertise. Her career achievements speak to decades of
          dedication: International Supreme Champion (1996), Reserve
          International Supreme Champion (2006), International Brace Champion,
          Scottish Brace Champion, and Scottish National Champion. Podcast
          interviews documenting her path reveal the experiences and mentors
          that shaped her approach, earning her recognition as "an absolute
          fountain of knowledge" within the sheepdog community.¹

          Hill's competitive success provided the foundation for her next
          chapter: systematic knowledge transfer. Understanding that traditional
          wisdom typically passed informally between generations could be
          structured and shared more broadly, she took deliberate steps to make
          expertise accessible.

             <p>
              The 2025 International Supreme Young Handler championship crowned
              14-year-old Chelsea Elkin, demonstrating that youth and elite
              performance aren't mutually exclusive. Working with her dog
              Marchup Jan at the prestigious Brynkinalt Estate in Chirk,
              Wrexham, Elkin displayed the skill, composure, and partnership
              that defines championship-level trialing. As the announcement
              noted, such achievement "at such a young age is truly inspiring
              the future is very bright for Chelsea and Marchup Jan."³
            </p>

            <p>
              At just 14, Elkin's success proves the sport actively welcomes and
              celebrates young talent. The International Sheepdog Society's
              dedicated young handler categories provide pathways for emerging
              competitors to test themselves at the highest levels, competing
              alongside and often outperforming handlers with decades more
              experience. Young handlers aren't tokens in this sport they're
              winning internationally and raising standards.

          <h3>From Childminder to Open Trial Winner</h3>
          <p>
            Victoria Graham entered the sport after watching her friend Tom Rome work his dogs. Inspired, she began training
            under mentors like Jeremy Martin.
          </p>

          <p>
            Her first dog <strong>Pip</strong> guided her through early learning stages — from novice events to open competition victories.
          </p>

          <h3>Reaching the English National</h3>
          <p>
            By 2019, Graham achieved her dream of competing at the English National, calling the experience
            "unforgettable and deeply special."
          </p>

          <h3>Building Her Own Path</h3>
          <p>
            She later trained her own dog <strong>Teal</strong>, renting a local field and raising Hebridean sheep
            specifically for training purposes.

      <div class="mt-4">
         <p>
                Graham  bred and trained her own dog, Teal, renting a small
                field nearby to start a flock of Hebridean sheep specifically
                for training. Teal's successful first nursery season placing
                most weekends, winning a nursery championship, and making the
                reserve list for the English Nursery Final proved that dedicated
                training outside traditional farming contexts produces
                competitive results.
              </p>

              <p>
                Graham's story demonstrates accessible entry points—you don't
                need a farm, just access to sheep through rental or arrangement,
                mentorship from experienced handlers willing to share knowledge,
                and commitment to the partnership. Her progression from complete
                beginner to English National competitor spans nine years of
                consistent effort, showing that expertise develops through
                dedication rather than requiring agricultural background.

        <p>
          The next generation of handlers often comes from unexpected
          backgrounds, proving the sport welcomes anyone with dedication.
          Victoria Graham, a childminder from Cumbria, exemplifies how sheepdog
          trialing fits diverse lifestyles. After watching her friend Tom Rome
          work his dogs, Graham was captivated: "I thought his skill was amazing
          and I knew I wanted to try it for myself."⁴
        </p>

        <p>
          Over nine years, Graham progressed from nervous beginner to open trial
          winner. Her first dog, Pip — bred by Rome and trained by Jeremy Martin
          — "put up with all my mistakes" as Graham learned through new handler
          and novice trials. By 2019, they won their first open competition.
          Graham achieved her dream of competing at the English National: "I
          will never forget walking out onto that trial field with her, such a
          special experience and one that I will always treasure."
