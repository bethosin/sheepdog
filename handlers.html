        <p>
          In 2021, Hill co-founded Sheepdog School to bridge the gap between
          championship-level expertise and aspiring handlers worldwide. The
          platform features over 150 videos documenting complete training
          journeys from puppy to trial winner, covering topics including
          starting young dogs on sheep, building solid foundations, progression
          through skill levels, solving common problems, and preparing for
          competition. This isn't simplified content for mass consumption—it's
          genuine expertise made accessible through structured teaching.²

          — World's first sheepdog training app with comprehensive video library
        </p>

        <p>
          Sheepdog School earned industry awards for its innovative approach and
          created the world's first sheepdog training app. The platform
          represents more than convenience—it's democratization of knowledge.
          Young people without farm backgrounds or local mentors can now access
          systematic instruction from proven champions, studying techniques at
          their own pace, reviewing complex maneuvers repeatedly, and building
          understanding before attempting practical application.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hill's methods emphasize partnership over dominance. Using
          pressure-and-release techniques rooted in understanding canine
          behavior, she teaches handlers to communicate in the dog's own
          language. Dogs trained through this approach control their own energy,
          use initiative rather than always waiting for commands, and work
          confidently even when handlers cannot see the sheep's behavior. This
          produces not just obedient animals, but thinking partners capable of
          independent problem-solving.

          <h3>A Rising Champion</h3>
          <p>
            At just 14 years old, Chelsea Elkin won the 2025 International Supreme Young Handler Championship with her dog
            <strong>Marchup Jan</strong>. Her success at the prestigious Brynkinalt Estate highlights the sport's thriving
            youth presence.
          </p>

          <p>
            Her calm handling, sharp timing, and strong partnership with her dog earned admiration from worldwide audiences.
          </p>

          <h3>Why Her Story Matters</h3>
          <p>
            Young competitors like Chelsea prove the sport welcomes — and celebrates — new generations.
            Her victory inspires young handlers everywhere.

               <h3>Youth at Elite Levels</h3>
             <p>
              The 2025 International Supreme Young Handler championship crowned
              14-year-old Chelsea Elkin, demonstrating that youth and elite
              performance aren't mutually exclusive. Working with her dog
              Marchup Jan at the prestigious Brynkinalt Estate in Chirk,
              Wrexham, Elkin displayed the skill, composure, and partnership
              that defines championship-level trialing. As the announcement
              noted, such achievement "at such a young age is truly inspiring
              the future is very bright for Chelsea and Marchup Jan."³
            </p>

            <p>
              At just 14, Elkin's success proves the sport actively welcomes and
              celebrates young talent. The International Sheepdog Society's
              dedicated young handler categories provide pathways for emerging
              competitors to test themselves at the highest levels, competing
              alongside and often outperforming handlers with decades more
              experience. Young handlers aren't tokens in this sport they're
              winning internationally and raising standards.

          <h3>From Childminder to Open Trial Winner</h3>
          <p>
            Victoria Graham entered the sport after watching her friend Tom Rome work his dogs. Inspired, she began training
            under mentors like Jeremy Martin.
          </p>

          <p>
            Her first dog <strong>Pip</strong> guided her through early learning stages — from novice events to open competition victories.
          </p>

          <h3>Reaching the English National</h3>
          <p>
            By 2019, Graham achieved her dream of competing at the English National, calling the experience
            "unforgettable and deeply special."
          </p>

          <h3>Building Her Own Path</h3>
          <p>
            She later trained her own dog <strong>Teal</strong>, renting a local field and raising Hebridean sheep
            specifically for training purposes.

      <div class="mt-4">
         <p>
                Graham  bred and trained her own dog, Teal, renting a small
                field nearby to start a flock of Hebridean sheep specifically
                for training. Teal's successful first nursery season placing
                most weekends, winning a nursery championship, and making the
                reserve list for the English Nursery Final proved that dedicated
                training outside traditional farming contexts produces
                competitive results.
              </p>

              <p>
                Graham's story demonstrates accessible entry points—you don't
                need a farm, just access to sheep through rental or arrangement,
                mentorship from experienced handlers willing to share knowledge,
                and commitment to the partnership. Her progression from complete
                beginner to English National competitor spans nine years of
                consistent effort, showing that expertise develops through
                dedication rather than requiring agricultural background.
